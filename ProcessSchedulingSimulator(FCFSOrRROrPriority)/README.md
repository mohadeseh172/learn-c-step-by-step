simulates the behavior of a CPU scheduler managing processes. The system should allow the user to:

Enter processes with their arrival time, burst time, and priority.
Choose a scheduling algorithm to simulate.
Display the execution order, waiting time, and turnaround time for each process.

Core Features
Scheduling Algorithms:

First-Come-First-Served (FCFS): Processes are executed in the order they arrive.
Round Robin (RR): Processes are executed in time slices (quantum) in a circular order.
Priority Scheduling: Processes are executed based on priority, with the highest priority first.
User Interaction:

Add processes dynamically.
Select and run a scheduling algorithm.
Display scheduling results.
