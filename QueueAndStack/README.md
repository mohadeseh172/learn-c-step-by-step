In this project, we implement two separate classes for Stack and Queue. Both classes include the following main operations:
stack:
Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Remove and return the top element of the stack.
Peek: View the top element of the stack without removing it.
Check if the stack is empty.
queue:
Enqueue: Adding an element to the end of the queue.
Dequeue: Remove and return the first element of the queue.
Peek: View the first element of the queue without removing it.
Check if the queue is empty.
