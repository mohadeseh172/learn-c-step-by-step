# learn-c-step-by-step
I aim to learn and practice C#, strengthen my understanding of fundamental computer science concepts, and enhance my knowledge of C# and essential skills that every developer should master.


To get started with C#, my preference is Visual Studio Enterprise because it’s free, very user-friendly, and packed with features. However, many people use VS Code because it’s lightweight, easy to use on Linux, and so on. Now, if you want to use VS Code to create and run a simple C# project, follow these steps:

Install the C# extension for VS Code.

Open the terminal in VS Code and check the .NET version using:

"dotnet --version"

Create a project in the terminal:

<< dotnet new console -n MyConsoleApp >>

Build the project:
dotnet build

Run the project:
dotnet run
